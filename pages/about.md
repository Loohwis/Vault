First off, I'd like to adress that I am not planning nor starting any cults, do not worry about that!

Anyways, my reasoning for the brand image and representation is that I have always been fascinated in human behaviour, topics alongside things like psychopaths... Over the years, trends that have happened on social medias such as TikTok, resemble cult-like tendencies. This really inspired me to document and discuss my opinions of these brands, and compare it to how cults were back before the "y2k" inspiration phase. I wanted to keep the actual aesthetic of the website to be minimalistic black and white thus i added greyscale to the 'modern' pictures in the banner. Creating the logo was very straightforward for me as I had a set design in mind, whilst maintaining the aspect of black and white i encorporated a gradient to make it flow nicer and reduce staticness, I want to make it seem like the logo is coming out of the website like symbiotically, the additional horns on top is just to make it clear the articles in the post are evil or have some sort of darkness.
