Charles Milles Manson was an American criminal born in Cincinnati, Ohio. Being the leader of the infamous cult 'The Manson Family', his name and reputation spread fear throughout America with his "family" committing a total of nine murders at four different locations between July-August of 1969. Manson spent the majority of his existence in correctional facilities which may reflect on his treatment towards the "family" culture. Later on, in his testimony he exclaimed that "My father is your system... I am only a reflection of you... Spent my life in the tombs you have built".

The Title stays consistent with the article "THE" maintaining a level cap height, whereas the enlarged cap height of "Manson" is proliferated, this allows the book to easily distinguish its contents towards any readers who walk by or observe it whilst also combining the element of spotlighting as we can now easily understand who the work will be based about. Furthermore, the heavy-weight of the title also conjures the image of a massive stamp slamming onto the book, my take on this is to provoke the absolutely grotesque crimes that led to his incarceration.
