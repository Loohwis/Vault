Charles Milles Manson was an American criminal born in Cincinnati, Ohio. Being the leader of the infamous cult 'The Manson Family', his name and reputation spread fear throughout America with his "family" committing a total of nine murders at four different locations between July-August of 1969. Manson spent the majority of his existence in correctional facilities which may reflect on his treatment towards the "family" culture. Later on, in his testimony he exclaimed that "My father is your system... I am only a reflection of you... Spent my life in the tombs you have built".

![A Publication by Schreck Nikolas was published in order to document the life of Manson. The Title instantly thick and heavy in weight with zero contrast, proliferating his surname. This allows the book to easily distinguish its contents towards any readers who walk by or observe it.](../uploads/manson-file.jpeg)
