Jacques Berman Webster II, also known as '*TRAVIS SCOTT*' is an American rapper. Scott signed his first major-label contract with Epic Records, and shortly after signed a publishing deal with Kanye's label 'GOOD Music'. In 2018, his third studio album, **Astroworld** was released and produced his first Billboard Hot 100. His career gained notoriety as safety within his concerts became questionable.

Let's start with the top then work our way down. To start with, the 'C' has a very large aperture and has a non-existing beak at the tips of each area. The weight of the character seems light, in actual fact it seems to be light throughout the whole lettering with only minor instances of a 'heavier' weight. Moving onto the 'A' of the logo, it appears to be missing a foot on the right side of the stroke, but once again there are no signs of serifs nor any sings of swashes.

From what we can observe on the bottom right, 'TRAVIS SCOTT' is written in a roman-style (standard type of style or regular weight of an upright typeface, although it does not contain any lowercase letters. The cap height and the baseline for the letters are consistent throughout the writing. However, directly underneath this 'HOUSTON, TX' has a far smaller font size, the font used is similar to the 'TRAVIS SCOTT' but from what I can observe is that the kerning (space in between two letters) is used much more than the lettering mentioned before. What is used for 'TRAVIS SCOTT' is also used for the date to further highlight what is the most important piece of information they want to show their crowd. Contrastingly, the words underneath the line that separates both texts contains serifs (small strokes at the beginning or end of a main letter), the weight for each letter on 'THE MOUNTAIN' is lighter than that of the one used for 'TRAVIS SCOTT' it appears to have contrasting weight however, much more evident on the 'U' and 'N'.
