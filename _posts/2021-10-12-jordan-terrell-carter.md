Jordan Terell Carter AKA. Playboi Carti, is an American rapper and singer-songwriter. With a huge fanbase that is global and often revered as an influential figure in the scene. He is known mostly through his experimental musical style, gothic fashion and an overall unique aesthetic. After beginning to gain mainstream attention in 2017 Carti ammased an almost ‘cult like following’, which will be our main focus whether it be through social media, books, brands you name it.

Initially his current aesthetic is displayed through the varying typefaces used within the album cover such as the use of Fraktur, this level of difference could be his expression of individualism and his overall skillset, this being experimental and all over the place. The all capitalised lettering which sticks out and screams into your face further supports this as the varying cap heights and descenders makes it unpredictable to guess what he is going to do but still induces excitement. Additionally, the crossbar on the letter ‘H’ is akwardly low , this with what seems to be the creator trying to keep the weight of the letters heavy, could possibly reflect his outlandishness.

From what we can observe the letter 'N' uses an overly exaggerated swash and multiple serifs to portray his artistry, the cap height of the letter is far larger with a very elongated descender
