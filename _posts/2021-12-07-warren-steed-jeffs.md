**Warren Steed Jeffs** is the president of the *Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,* a polygamous denomination. Jeffs was placed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List, convicted of two felony counts of child sexual assault and arranged illegal marriages between his followers (whom were underaged).

I noticed that when writing these articles, the same exact details of the title's typeface is present in all 'cult' related books/documentaries. Therefore, we can once again observe that the title uses a serifless typeface, and is fully capitalised (similar to the "Jim Jones" book). Another similarity that we can observe is the solid colour of red that embodies the characters used. The cap height of the title is even throughout and the kerning of the letters (gap between each letter) is uniform. Similarly to how I described a previous article, this could be an underlying representation of collectivism and destroying any sense of individuality. This is obvious as the 'family' per se of the *Fundamentalist Church* (majority young girls) were all married to one power-head of the group, all bearing the term of 'wife' to this horrid man. However, one unique aspect to the typeface of this book is that there is a very fluctuating weight, having pieces missing or what it looks like to be chunks (bitten off) in my opinion symbolizes the beastly nature of Jeffs, preying on young, vulnerable girls and exploiting them for his sexual benefit.
