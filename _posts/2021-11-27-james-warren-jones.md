**James Warren Jones** (A.K.A Jim Jones) was an American cult leader, preacher and faith healer who led the *Peoples Temple,* a newly formed organization concealed as a religious group which lasted between 1955-1978. Notoriously known for his orchestrated 'inner-circle' mass murder-suicide at Jonestown.
