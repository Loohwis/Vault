<h2>LOCATION</h2>
<p>
  I am as of now living in a house of 4 in Oxford, the city itself is beautiful and is more than capable of clearing any form of writers block, the aesthetic that surrounds Oxford is quite awe inspiring, bustling with students due to both unis Oxford and Oxford Brookes.

<h2>ACHIEVEMENTS/GOALS</h2>
<p>As for now, I have attained certificates from school programmes such as the Brilliant club. I am hoping to write and publish articles for VICE or MUNCHIES as I am drawn into their style of broadcasting/newspresenting. 
Currently, I am writing article entries and hopefully get some published by smaller and independent companies. Overall, my end goal is to gain experience and skill throughout each article I write, and possibly evolve the way that I convey stories or thoughts.
